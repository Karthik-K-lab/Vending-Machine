<h1>📦Vending Machine🖥</h1>

<p>
This is a simple vending machine simulation project written in Python.
It uses the <code>sqlite3</code> library🛢 to store datas and the <code>time</code> library⏱️ to add small delays for a more realistic experience.
The project is built and executed in Google Colab, and the code is provided in a notebook📒 (.ipynb) format.
</p>

<p>
Each cell in the notebook contains comments💬 explaining what that part of the code does. 
There are optional cells🔍 to view database tables or reset the data (delete records and delete tables), so run these if needed.
The final cell contains the actual vending machine program. It is recommended to hide the cell's code and only use the output interface, if needed zoom out a little bit to cover the vending machine.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to explore and modify the code. Enjoy!🎮
